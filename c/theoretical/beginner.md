  <summary>What is C language?</summary>
  C language is a structure/procedure oriented, middle level programming language developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.
  C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system.
  In 1978, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> published the first edition “The C Programming Language”.
  Also, C language is an ANSI/ISO standard and powerful programming language for developing real time applications

  <summary>What is the difference between top down approach and bottom up approach in programming languages?</summary>
  Top down approach and bottom up approach are involved in software development. These approaches are not involved in program execution.    
    <table >
  <tr>
    <th>Top down approach</th>
    <th>Bottom up approach</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Structure/procedure oriented programming languages like C programming language follows top down approach.</td>
    <td>Object oriented programming languages like C++ and Java programming language follows bottom up approach.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Top down approach begins with high level design and ends with low level design or development. </td>
    <td>Bottom up approach begins with low level design or development and ends with high level design.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In top down approach, main() function is written first and all sub functions are called from main function. Then, sub functions are written based on the requirement.</td>
    <td>In bottom up approach, code is developed for modules and then these modules are integrated with main() function.</td>
  </tr>

  <summary>What is header file in C language?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Header file is a file that contains function declaration and macro definition for C in-built library functions.</li>
        <li>All C standard library functions are declared in many header files which are saved as file_name.h.</li>
        <li>We are including these header files in our C program using “#include <file_name.h>” command to make use of the functions those are declared in the header files.</li>
        <li>When we include header files in our C program using “#include <filename.h>” command, all C code of the header files are included in C program. Then, this C program is compiled by compiler and executed.</li>
    </ul>

  <summary>Is C language case sensitive?</summary>
  Yes. C language instructions/commands/functions and everything used in C program are case sensitive.
    </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What is Macro? Why do we use macro?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Macro is a name which is given to a value or to a piece of code/block in a program. Instead of using the value, we can use macro which will replace the value in a program.</li>
        <li>The reason for using macro is, consider below example.</li>
        <li>You are using a person’s age as 50 in many places in your program. If you use direct value in all the places in your program, it is very difficult to change the age value in future if you want to change it to 60. If you use macro in your program, it is very simple to replace the value and we can change in only one place which will change the value in all places in your program.</li>
        <code>

        Syntax: #define <MACRO_NAME> VALUE
        Example:
        Original declaration – #define AGE 50
        Modified declaration – #define AGE 60

      
    </ul>
    </code>

  <summary>What is data type in C?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Data types in C language are defined as the data storage format that a variable can store a data to perform a specific operation.</li>
        <li>Data types are used to define a variable before to use in a program.</li>
        <li>Size of variable, constant and array are determined by data types.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What is the difference between int, char, float and double data types?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Integer data type allows a variable to store numeric values. The storage size of <strong>int</strong> data type is 2 or 4 or 8 byte. It varies depend upon the processor in the CPU.</li>
        <li>Character data type allows a variable to store only one character. Storage size of character data type is 1.</li>
        <li>Float data type allows a variable to store decimal values. Storage size of float data type is 4. This also varies depend upon the processor in the CP.</li>
        <li>Double data type is also same as float data type which allows up-to 10 digits after decimal.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What is the use of sizeof() function in C?</summary>
  sizeof() function is used to find the memory space allocated for each data type in C.
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What is modifier in C?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>The amount of memory space to be allocated for a variable is derived by modifiers.</li>
        <li>Modifiers are prefixed with basic data types to modify (either increase or decrease) the amount of storage space allocated to a variable.</li>
        <li>For example, storage space for int data type is 4 byte for 32 bit processor. We can increase the range by using long int which is 8 byte. We can decrease the range by using short int which is 2 byte.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What are different types of modifiers in C?</summary>
  There are 5 modifiers available in C language. They are,
  <ul>
        <li>short</li>
        <li>long</li>
        <li>signed</li>
        <li>unsigned</li>
        <li>long long</li>

  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What is enum in C?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Enumeration is a data type that consists of named integer constants as a list.</li>
        <li>It start with 0 (zero) by default and value is incremented by 1 for the sequential identifiers in the list.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What is void in C?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Void is an empty data type that has no value.</li>
        <li>We use void data type in functions when we don’t want to return any value to the calling function.</li>
        <li>Example:
        void sum (int a, int b); – This function won’t return any value to the calling function.
        int sum (int a, int b); – This function will return value to the calling function.</li>
        <li>We use void data type in pointer like “void *p”. It means, pointer “p” is neither pointing to int data type nor char data type. It acts as generic pointer. We are using void pointer when we are not sure on the data type that this pointer will point to. We can use void pointer to refer either integer data or char data. But, this void pointer should not be dereferenced without explicit type casting.</li>
        <li>We use void in functions as “int function_name (void)”. Here void means, this function does not pass any argument.</li>
    </ul>

  <summary>What is token in C?</summary>
  <ul>
