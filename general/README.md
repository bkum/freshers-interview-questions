  <summary>What is meant by programming language, give some examples?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Programming language is nothing but a language designed to communicate to machines through instructions and commands.</li>
        <li>Normally machines are computers. Programs are written using some programming languages to control the behaviour of machines/computers and to make them to perform required tasks.</li>
        <li>Programming language example: Assembly language, C language, C++ language, Java, C#, .NET, Python etc</li>
    </ul>

  <summary>What do you mean by high level, middle level and low level languages and give an example for each?</summary>
  <h3>High level languages</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>These level languages provide almost everything that the programmer might need to do as already build into the language.</li>
        <li>Example: Java, Python</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Middle level languages</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>These languages don’t provide all the built-in functions found in high level languages, but provide all building blocks that we need to produce the result we want.</li>
        <li>Example: C, C++</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Low level languages</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>These languages provide nothing other than access to the machine’s basic instruction set.</li>
        <li>Example: Assembly language.</li>
    </ul>

  <summary>What is the difference between structured oriented, object oriented and non-structure oriented programming language?</summary>
  <h3>Structured oriented programming language</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>In this type of language, large programs are divided into small programs called functions.</li>
        <li>Prime focus is on functions and procedures that operate on data</li>
        <li>Data moves freely around the systems from one function to another</li>
        <li>Program structure follows “Top Down Approach”</li>
        <li>Example: C, Pascal, ALGOL and Modula-2</li>
   </ul>
  <h3>Object oriented programming language</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>In this type of language, programs are divided into objects.</li>
        <li>Prime focus is on the data that is being operated and not on the functions or procedures</li>
        <li>Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions</li>
        <li>Program structure follows “Bottom UP Approach”</li>
        <li>Example: C++, JAVA and C# (C sharp)</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Non-structure oriented programming language</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>There is no specific structure for programming this language.</li>
        <li>Example:  BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN.</li>
    </ul>

  <summary>What is compiler?</summary>
  Compiler is a program that converts human readable code into machine readable code. This process is called compilation.
    </details>
- <details>
  <summary>What is the difference between assembler, compiler and interpreter?</summary>
  <ul>
        <li>Assembler is a program that converts assembly level language (low level language) into machine level language.</li>
        <li>Compiler compiles entire C source code into machine code.</li>
        <li>Interpreters converts source code into intermediate code and then this intermediate code is executed line by line.</li>
    </ul>
